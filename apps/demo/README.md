# Framecrafter Demo

This is the POC web-app for Framecrafter's in-browser editor. It's written using React, Vite, and Tailwind.

## Local Development

> **Note**
> We use `pnpm` as our package manager. So, if your fingers are used to typing `npm` for commands, keep in mind that you need to add that extra `p` 😊.
